First clone the project to your local machine. You will then need to open up your IDE and import the project. Once imported locate the runner class within the IMS src folder and run the program.

You can then choose the different CRUD functions and implement what you want to do.

## Running the tests

To run tests navigate to the project tree and find the src/test/javafolder. Right click here and go to coverage as -> JUnit test which will allow the tests to run and then display the coverage.


When running the programme it will open with a welcome message and will prompt you to chose a controller you want to use: customer, item and order. Once chosen it wil prompt you to choose a CRUD functionality and then you simply follow the prompts afterwards depending on controller and functionality, which wil dictate your input.
